 abstract = {In shoot'em up games, the player engages in a solitary assault against a large number of enemies, which calls for a very fast adaptation of the player to a continuous evolution of the enemies attack patterns. This genre of video game is quite appropriate for studying and evaluating dynamic difficulty adaptivity in games that can adapt themselves to the player's skill level while keeping him/her constantly motivated. In this paper, we evaluate the use of dynamic adaptivity for casual and hardcore players, from the perspectives of the flow theory and the model of core elements of the game experience. Also we present an adaptive model for shoot'em up games based on player modeling and online learning, which is both simple and effective},
